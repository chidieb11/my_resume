              I interned at Byteworks Technology as a junior fullstack developer
              for a duration of four months. During my time there, I contributed
              to the building of few highly scalable solutions where I was
              tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the solutions passed
              end to end testing before they are deployed to production.
