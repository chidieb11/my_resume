            I interned at Byteworks Technology as a junior fullstack developer
            for a duration of four months. During my time there, I contributed
            to the building of few highly scalable solutions where I was tasked
            with the responsibility of ensuring the solutions passed end to end
            testing before they are deployed to production.
